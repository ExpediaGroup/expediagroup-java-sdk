                Search property content for active properties in the requested language.<br><br>

                When searching with query parameter, `property_id`, you may request 1 to 250 properties at a time.<br><br>

                When searching with query parameters other than `property_id`, the response will be paginated. The response will contain a header, `Link`. The `Link` header contains a single URL to get the immediate next page of results, and follows the [IETF standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). To get the next page of results, simply follow the `next` URL in the `Link` header without modifying it. When no `Link` header is returned with an empty body and a 200 response code, the pagination has completed. If the link expires, there will be an `expires` link-extension that is the UTC date the link will expire, in ISO 8601 format.<br>

                  * Example: `<https://api.ean.com/v3/properties/content?token=MY5S3j36cOcLfLBZjPYQ1abhfc8CqmjmFVzkk7euvWaunE57LLeDgaxm516m>; rel="next"; expires="2019-03-05T07:23:14.000Z"`<br><br>

                The response is a JSON map where the key is the property ID and the value is the property object itself, which can include property-level, room-level and rate-level information.

                      Continue to pass the same value for each subsequent API call during the user's session, using a new value for every new customer session.<br>
                      Including this value greatly eases EPS's internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it explicitly links together request paths for individual user's session.

                Returns the geographic definition and property mappings of regions matching the specified parameters.<br><br>

                To request all regions in the world, omit the `ancestor` query parameter. To request all regions in a specific continent, country or other level, specify the ID of that region as the `ancestor`. Refer to the list of [top level regions](https://developers.expediagroup.com/docs/rapid/lodging/geography/geography-reference-lists).<br><br>

                The response is a paginated list of regions. The response will contain a header, `Link`. The `Link` header contains a single URL to get the immediate next page of results, and follows the [IETF standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). To get the next page of results, simply follow the `next` URL in the `Link` header without modifying it. When no `Link` header is returned with an empty body and a 200 response code, the pagination has completed. If the link expires, there will be an `expires` link-extension that is the UTC date the link will expire, in ISO 8601 format.<br>

If the price is matched, the response returns a link to request a booking. If the price has changed, the response returns new price details and a booking link for the new price. If the rate is no longer available, the response will return a new Property Availability request link to search again for different rates. In the event of a price change, go back to Property Availability and book the property at the new price or return to additional rates for the property.

                This API call returns itinerary details and links to resume or cancel the booking. There are two methods to retrieve a booking:
                * Using the link included in the original Book response, example: https://api.ean.com/v3/itineraries/8955599932111?token=QldfCGlcUA4GXVlSAQ4W
                * Using the email of the booking. If the email contains special characters, they must be encoded to successfully retrieve the booking. Example: https://api.ean.com/v3/itineraries/8955599932111?email=customer@email.com

                <i>Note: Newly created itineraries may sometimes have a small delay between the time of creation and the time that the itinerary can be retrieved. If you receive an error when trying to retrieve an itinerary that was successfully created, please wait a few minutes before trying to retrieve the itinerary again.</i>

                Returns a complete collection of chains recognized by the Rapid API.

                <br>Chains represent a parent company which can have multiple brands associated with it. A brand can only be associated with one chain. For example, Hilton Worldwide is a chain that has multiple associated brands including Doubletree, Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites.

                <br>The response is a JSON map where the key is the chain ID and the value is a chain object. Each chain object also contains a map of its related brands.

                <br>Note that the set of chain IDs and brand IDs are totally independent of one another. It is possible for a chain and a brand to both use the same number as their ID, but this is just a coincidence that holds no meaning.

                <br>Chain and brand names are provided in English only.
