# Expedia Group JVM SDK - OkHttp Transport
The `expediagroup-sdk-transport-okhttp` module provides an implementation of the `Transport` interface using the [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) library. This module is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Expedia Group SDK, enabling efficient and reliable HTTP communication for SDK clients.

## Overview
This module acts as a bridge between the core SDK's `Transport` abstraction and the OkHttp library. It provides the following key features:
- Converts SDK `Request` objects into OkHttp requests.
- Executes HTTP requests using OkHttp's client.
- Converts OkHttp responses back into SDK `Response` objects.
- Handles network exceptions and maps them to SDK-specific exceptions.
- Supports custom configuration of the OkHttp client
  
## Installation
The `expediagroup-sdk-transport-okhttp` module requires **Java 8** or higher.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Maven</strong></summary>

  Add the `expediagroup-sdk-transport-okhttp` as a dependency in your `pom.xml`:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.expediagroup</groupId>
    <artifactId>expediagroup-sdk-transport-okhttp</artifactId>
    <version>{latest-version}</version>
  </dependency>
  ```
</details>


<details>
  <summary><strong>Gradle</strong></summary>

  Add the `expediagroup-sdk-core` as a dependency in your `build.gradle`:

  ```gradle
  implementation 'com.expediagroup:expediagroup-sdk-transport-okhttp:{latest-version}'
  ```
</details>

### Auto-Detection of Transport
Once the `expediagroup-sdk-transport-okhttp` dependency is added to your project, the core SDK module will automatically detect and use it as the transport implementation using the `ServiceLoader` mechanism. There is no need for explicit instantiation or configuration.

> [!Tip]
> Do **not** include `expediagroup-sdk-transport-okhttp` as a dependency in your product SDK artifact. Instead, ask end users to add it (or any other transport implementation) alongside your SDK in their applicationâ€™s build. This ensures they can choose the HTTP transport they prefer.
>
> Currently, only the OkHttp transport is available; future releases may offer additional implementations.
