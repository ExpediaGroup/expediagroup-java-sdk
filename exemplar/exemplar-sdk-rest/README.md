# 🧪 Exemplar REST SDK

This module is a **reference implementation** demonstrating how to build REST-based SDKs using the [Expedia Group SDK core libraries](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup). It serves as a guide for developers looking to create their own SDKs with best practices and consistent structure.


## 🎯 Purpose

* **🔧 Showcase**: Illustrates how to structure and implement a REST SDK using EG SDK core modules.
* **📚 Reference**: Provides practical examples for interacting with REST APIs, including authentication, error handling, and modeling.
* **🧠 Learning**: Aids new contributors in understanding the architecture and extensibility of the EG SDK ecosystem.


## 🧱 Structure

This REST Exemplar SDK mainly depends on [`expediagroup-sdk-rest`](../../expediagroup-sdk-rest) and [`expediagroup-sdk-openapi-plugin`](../../expediagroup-sdk-openapi-plugin). These modules facilitate building and generating an SDK for your API based on an OpenAPI specification.

### ⚙️ Build File Configurations

1. Applies the EG SDK OpenAPI plugin for code generation. This plugin is primarily used to generate models and operations—not the SDK clients. See the plugin's [README](../../expediagroup-sdk-openapi-plugin/README.md) for more details.
2. Adds [`expediagroup-sdk-rest`](../../expediagroup-sdk-rest) as an `api` dependency.
3. Includes Jackson dependencies for serialization and deserialization.
4. Adds the SLF4J API, allowing users to plug in their preferred logging implementation.
5. Defines a Gradle task to transform the OpenAPI spec using [spec-transformer](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/spec-transformer). This ensures the spec adheres to SDK generator standards.

### 📦 Source Code Structure

1. [`client`](./src/main/kotlin/com/expediagroup/sdk/exemplar/rest/client): Contains manually implemented SDK clients. These are the main entry points used by consumers. See the [REST module documentation](../../expediagroup-sdk-rest/README.md) for details.
2. [`core`](./src/main/kotlin/com/expediagroup/sdk/exemplar/rest/core): Contains integration classes for the core executors. See the [Core module documentation](../../expediagroup-sdk-core/README.md).
3. [`model`](./src/main/kotlin/com/expediagroup/sdk/exemplar/rest/model): Auto-generated by [`expediagroup-sdk-openapi-plugin`](../../expediagroup-sdk-openapi-plugin). Contains data model classes based on the OpenAPI spec.
4. [`operation`](./src/main/kotlin/com/expediagroup/sdk/exemplar/rest/operation): Auto-generated operations corresponding to API endpoints defined in the OpenAPI spec.

### 📄 OpenAPI Specification Files

1. [`openapi.yaml`](./openapi.yaml): The original OpenAPI spec file generated from the [`exemplar-server`](../exemplar-server) source code.
2. [`transformed-spec.yml`](./transformed-spec.yml): A modified version of the original spec used as input for SDK generation.


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start the Server**
   Make sure the `exemplar-server` is running and the OpenAPI specification is up to date.

2. **Build the SDK**
   From the project root, run:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew :exemplar:exemplar-sdk-rest:build
   ```

3. **Explore and Customize**
   Use the generated SDK as a starting point and tailor it to your own API structure and requirements.

|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `openapi.yaml` | The OpenAPI specification generated from `exemplar-server`. |
| `src/main/`    | Contains the SDK implementation and customization code.     |
