# Expedia Group JVM SDK - REST Module
The REST extension module delivers first-class support for building type-safe HTTP clients. It handles JSON deserialization out of the box, and maps HTTP status codes to domain-specific exceptions all while plugging seamlessly into the core SDKâ€™s execution pipeline for authentication, logging, and more.

Packaged as its own artifact `com.expediagroup:expediagroup-sdk-rest`, it keeps non-REST SDKs lean: simply add the REST dependency to your build and Maven/Gradle will transitively pull in the core module for you.
