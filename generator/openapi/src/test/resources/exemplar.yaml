                            * For a top level field, it should only be set to the field name (e.g. `firstName`).
                            * For a field in a nested object, it may contain the path to reach the field (e.g. `address.city`).

                        When specified, the `location` and `name` should be specified as well.
                        This value may be omitted in cases where it cannot be provided (e.g. missing require field), or the erroneous value cannot be represented as a string.
