## Properties

|---|---|
| [currency](index.md#-187579808%2FProperties%2F699445674) | [JVM]<br>private final [String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)[currency](index.md#-187579808%2FProperties%2F699445674)<br>Value should be a standard ISO 3 letter currency code.  The currency code that is associated to the `TotalPrice` element for the selected property's rate plan from the Lodging Listing API response.  The `currency` element will be automatically included in the ApiDetails HATEOAS link which is returned along with the Lodging Details response. |
| [groupedAmenities](index.md#162357272%2FProperties%2F699445674) | [JVM]<br>private final [Boolean](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Boolean.html)[groupedAmenities](index.md#162357272%2FProperties%2F699445674)<br>Specifies whether to return the grouped amenities. If `groupedAmenities` is true, `DescriptiveAmenities` node will be returned in response, otherwise `Amenities` node will be returned. |
| [imageSizes](index.md#-1316289478%2FProperties%2F699445674) | [JVM]<br>private final [GetLodgingDetailsOperationParams.ImageSizes](-image-sizes/index.md)[imageSizes](index.md#-1316289478%2FProperties%2F699445674)<br>Indicate what size of image will be returned.  The available image sizes are: - t : Thumbnail - s : Small - b : Big - y : 500x500v - z : 1000x1000v  Resolution from smallest to largest is t < s < b < y < z.  If no `imageSizes` is specified, the t size images will be returned.  If an image is missing in one size, we will try to fall back to the same image with lower resolution.  (If image \&quot;_z\&quot; is not available, we will try to return image \&quot;_y\&quot;, and if it is also unavailable, we will return image \&quot;_b\&quot;, and so on.)  Only one image size is allowed. |
| [locale](index.md#-1262785225%2FProperties%2F699445674) | [JVM]<br>private final [String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)[locale](index.md#-1262785225%2FProperties%2F699445674)<br>`locale` is composed of language identifier and region identifier, connected by \&quot;_\&quot; that specifies the language in which the response will be returned.  The `locale` value used in the Lodging Details API query should match the `locale` value that was used in the Lodging Search API query. |
| [offerToken](index.md#-1233685004%2FProperties%2F699445674) | [JVM]<br>private final [String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)[offerToken](index.md#-1233685004%2FProperties%2F699445674)<br>A Hotel Natural Key from the Lodging Search API -> Hotels -> RoomTypes -> OfferId. It is a concatenated string of multiple values that defines a hotel offer. |
| [partnerTransactionId](index.md#-848071744%2FProperties%2F699445674) | [JVM]<br>private final [String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)[partnerTransactionId](index.md#-848071744%2FProperties%2F699445674)<br>The `Partner-Transaction-ID` is a required API request header element that is <u>not</u> consumed by Expedia. It will be required in all XAP v3 API request headers and will be mirrored back to the partner in the corresponding API response header.  The `Partner-Transaction-ID` may be any alphanumeric string of the partner's choosing. |
| [price](index.md#-1792883328%2FProperties%2F699445674) | [JVM]<br>private final [String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)[price](index.md#-1792883328%2FProperties%2F699445674)<br>The total price of the selected property.  This value will be used to determine if there is a price change between the details and booking request.  The `price` element will be automatically included in the ApiDetails HATEOAS link which is returned along with the Lodging Details API response. |
