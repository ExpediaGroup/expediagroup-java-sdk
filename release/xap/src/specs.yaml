            You can find a link to the complete list of `locales` along with the Point of Sale List in [Supported Points of Sale](https://developers.expediagroup.com/xap/products/xap/lodging/references/supported-points-of-sale). Note that even though the Listings API supports localization for all `locales` listed in the list, all `locales` are not valid for all Points of Sale.


            For example, Ecom US POS supports `en_US`, `es_MX` and `zh_CN`. For Ecom US POS, the Listings API will respond with content in Spanish for requests with either `locale=es_MX` or `es_US`. However, only the deeplinks for `locale=es_MX` should work properly and switch the website to Spanish, while the ones for locale=es_US will be fallen back to English.


            If not specified in the query, the native language for that POS will be returned.

            And if more than one language is supported, the response will be returned in the first language

            depending on the language setting of the POS.

            This parameter requires that a `checkIn` date and `checkOut` date be supplied, as the API cannot return additional room rates on a dateless search.


            Including `allRoomTypes=true` in your query will automatically limit your response size to no more than 200 hotels.

            - WEB (include all website links)

            - API (links for Details and RateCalendar API)


            There are two level of links returned in the API response: Property-level deeplinks and room-level deeplinks.


            When requesting API deeplinks you will receive both a RateCalendar API link at the property level,

            and Details API links at the room level, since the Lodging Details API only displays information

            on rate plan offers.


            When requesting AD deeplinks, you will <u>only</u> receive Details API links at the room level.

            `Links` node in property-level will be omitted.


            If you are looking for more complete details on a single property via the API, you should do another search

            in the Lodging API for the single Hotel ID, with `contentDetails=high` to get all details back in return

            (note that you can only get back a maximum of 5 hotels when `contentDetails` is set to `high`).


            **NOTE**: dateless searches will not return Details API links, since the Lodging Details API will only

            return details on a specific room offer for specific dates.

            The `limit` parameter is intended to be used to control the response size, but partners should be careful

            about combining it with other filter parameters, as each parameter that you add will shrink the response,

            even to the point where you may even get a "no hotel found" error if none of the hotels in the base response

            meet the combined filter requirements.


            Filters are cumulative in effect, and results must meet all filter requirements to be displayed.
