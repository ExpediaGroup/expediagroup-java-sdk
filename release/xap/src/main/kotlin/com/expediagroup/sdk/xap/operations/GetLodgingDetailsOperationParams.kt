/**
 * @property offerToken A Hotel Natural Key from the Lodging Search API -> Hotels -> RoomTypes -> OfferId. It is a concatenated string of multiple values that defines a hotel offer.
 * @property partnerTransactionId The `Partner-Transaction-ID` is a required API request header element that is <u>not</u> consumed by Expedia. It will be required in all XAP v3 API request headers and will be mirrored back to the partner in the corresponding API response header.  The `Partner-Transaction-ID` may be any alphanumeric string of the partner's choosing.
 * @property price The total price of the selected property.  This value will be used to determine if there is a price change between the details and booking request.  The `price` element will be automatically included in the ApiDetails HATEOAS link which is returned along with the Lodging Details API response.
 * @property currency Value should be a standard ISO 3 letter currency code.  The currency code that is associated to the `TotalPrice` element for the selected property's rate plan from the Lodging Listing API response.  The `currency` element will be automatically included in the ApiDetails HATEOAS link which is returned along with the Lodging Details response.
 * @property locale `locale` is composed of language identifier and region identifier, connected by \"_\" that specifies the language in which the response will be returned.  The `locale` value used in the Lodging Details API query should match the `locale` value that was used in the Lodging Search API query.
 * @property imageSizes Indicate what size of image will be returned.  The available image sizes are: - t : Thumbnail - s : Small - b : Big - y : 500x500v - z : 1000x1000v  Resolution from smallest to largest is t < s < b < y < z.  If no `imageSizes` is specified, the t size images will be returned.  If an image is missing in one size, we will try to fall back to the same image with lower resolution.  (If image \"_z\" is not available, we will try to return image \"_y\", and if it is also unavailable, we will return image \"_b\", and so on.)  Only one image size is allowed.
 * @property groupedAmenities Specifies whether to return the grouped amenities. If `groupedAmenities` is true, `DescriptiveAmenities` node will be returned in response, otherwise `Amenities` node will be returned.
