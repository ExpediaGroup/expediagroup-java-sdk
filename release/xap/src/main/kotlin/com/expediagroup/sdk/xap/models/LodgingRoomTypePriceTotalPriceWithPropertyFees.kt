/**
 * The total price of the rate plan include property mandatory fees, which is equal to the sum of `BaseRate` + `TaxesAndFees` + `PropertyMandatoryFees`. **NOTE**: Since UK regulations require that `PropertyMandatoryFees` be included in this price, the quoted price will <u>only</u> be accurate for the day of quote. This is due to the fact that currency exchange fluctuations will change the exact amount of any `PropertyMandatoryFees` that are to be collected at the hotel during the guest's stay if the cost is converted into any other currency. **CMA Compliance Note (UK)**: Websites doing business in the UK should be displaying this value to be compliant with CMA requirements.
