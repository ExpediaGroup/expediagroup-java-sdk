Commit a change of itinerary that may require additional payment or refund. This link will be available in the change response to confirm and complete the change transaction.  If additional charges are due, a payment must be submitted with this request. Note that Two-Factor  Authentication is not supported at this time.

#### Return

a Response object with a body of type Nothing

#### Parameters

JVM

| | |
|---|---|
| customerIp | IP address of the customer, as captured by your integration. Send IPV4 addresses only.<br> Ensure your integration passes the customer's IP, not your own. This value helps determine their location and assign the correct payment gateway.<br> Also used for fraud recovery and other important analytics. |
| itineraryId | This parameter is used only to prefix the token value - no ID value is used.<br> |
| roomId | Room ID of a property.<br> |
| token | Provided as part of the link object and used to maintain state across calls. This simplifies each subsequent call by limiting the amount of information required at each step and reduces the potential for errors. Token values cannot be viewed or changed. |
| customerSessionId | Insert your own unique value for each user session, beginning with the first API call. Continue to pass the same value for each subsequent API call during the user's session, using a new value for every new customer session.<br> Including this value greatly eases EPS's internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it explicitly links together request paths for individual user's session.  (optional) |
| test | The change call has a test header that can be used to return set responses with the following keywords:<br> * `standard` - Requires valid test booking. * `service_unavailable` * `unknown_internal_error`  (optional) |
| commitChangeRoomRequestBody | The request body is required if additional payment is necessary. The body can optionally contain the `change_reference_id`.  (optional) |

#### Throws

| |
|---|
| [ExpediaGroupApiErrorException](../../com.expediagroup.sdk.rapid.models.exception/-expedia-group-api-error-exception/index.md) |
