Retrieve Booking This API call returns itinerary details and links to resume or cancel the booking. There are two methods to retrieve a booking: * Using the link included in the original Book response, example: https://api.ean.com/v3/itineraries/8955599932111?token=QldfCGlcUA4GXVlSAQ4W * Using the email of the booking. If the email contains special characters, they must be encoded to successfully retrieve the booking. Example: https://api.ean.com/v3/itineraries/8955599932111?email=customer@email.com  <i>Note: Newly created itineraries may sometimes have a small delay between the time of creation and the time that the itinerary can be retrieved. If you receive an error when trying to retrieve an itinerary that was successfully created, please wait a few minutes before trying to retrieve the itinerary again.</i>

#### Return

a Response object with a body of type Itinerary

#### Parameters

JVM

| | |
|---|---|
| customerIp | IP address of the customer, as captured by your integration.<br> Ensure your integration passes the customer's IP, not your own. This value helps determine their location and assign the correct payment gateway.<br> Also used for fraud recovery and other important analytics. |
| itineraryId | This parameter is used only to prefix the token value - no ID value is used.<br> |
| customerSessionId | Insert your own unique value for each user session, beginning with the first API call. Continue to pass the same value for each subsequent API call during the user's session, using a new value for every new customer session.<br> Including this value greatly eases EPS's internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it explicitly links together request paths for individual user's session.  (optional) |
| test | The retrieve call has a test header that can be used to return set responses. Passing standard in the Test header will retrieve a test booking, and passing any of the errors listed below will return a stubbed error response that you can use to test your error handling code. Additionally, refer to the Test Request documentation for more details on how these header values are used. * `standard` - Requires valid test booking. * `service_unavailable` * `internal_server_error`  (optional) |
| token | Provided as part of the link object and used to maintain state across calls. This simplifies each subsequent call by limiting the amount of information required at each step and reduces the potential for errors. Token values cannot be viewed or changed.  (optional) |
| email | Email associated with the booking. Special characters in the local part or domain should be encoded. (Email is required if the token is not provided the request) <br>  (optional) |
| include | Options for which information to return in the response. The value must be lower case.   * history - Include itinerary history, showing details of the changes made to this itinerary  (optional) |
