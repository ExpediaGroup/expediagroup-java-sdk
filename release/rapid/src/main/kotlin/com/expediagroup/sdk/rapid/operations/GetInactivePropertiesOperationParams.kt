 * @property customerSessionId Insert your own unique value for each user session, beginning with the first API call.

 * @property since Required on initial call, not accepted on subsequent paging links provided in response header.<br> The earliest date that a property became inactive to include in the results. ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
 * @property token Only used for requesting additional pages of data. Provided by the `next` URL in the `Link` response header.
 * @property billingTerms This parameter is to specify the terms of how a resulting booking should be billed. If this field is needed, the value for this will be provided to you separately.
 * @property paymentTerms This parameter is to specify what terms should be used when being paid for a resulting booking. If this field is needed, the value for this will be provided to you separately.
