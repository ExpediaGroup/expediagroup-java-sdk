 * @property since Required on initial call, not accepted on subsequent paging links provided in response header.<br> The earliest date that a property became inactive to include in the results. ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
 * @property token Only used for requesting additional pages of data. Provided by the `next` URL in the `Link` response header.
 * @property billingTerms This parameter is to specify the terms of how a resulting booking should be billed. If this field is needed, the value for this will be provided to you separately.
