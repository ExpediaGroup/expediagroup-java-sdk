 * @property customerIp IP address of the customer, as captured by your integration.<br> Ensure your integration passes the customer's IP, not your own. This value helps determine their location and assign the correct payment gateway.<br> Also used for fraud recovery and other important analytics.
 * @property customerSessionId Insert your own unique value for each user session, beginning with the first API call.

Passing standard in the Test header will retrieve a test booking, and passing any of the errors listed below will return a stubbed error response that you can use to test your error handling code.
