        Search property content for active properties in the requested
        language.<br><br>

        When searching with query parameter, `property_id`, you may request 1 to 250 properties at a time.<br><br>

        When searching with query parameters other than `property_id`, the response will be paginated. See the `Link`

        header in the 200 response section.<br><br>

        The response is a JSON map where the key is the property ID and the value is the property object itself, which

        can include property-level, room-level and rate-level information.

            session.<br>

            Including this value greatly eases EPS's internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it

            explicitly links together request paths for individual user's session.

              * radius,region_id
              * radius,latitude,longitude

            Radius combined with region id would search an area that extends the number of kilometers out from the boundaries of the region in all directions.<br>

            Radius combined with a single point, specified by a latitude, longitude pair would search an area in a circle with the specified radius and the point as the center.<br>

            Radius should be specified in non-negative whole kilometers, decimals will return an error. A radius of 0 is allowed.<br>

            When specifying the area parameter, there will be a limit of 100 results, which can be narrowed further by the limit parameter.<br>

            Due to the number of results, unless `point_of_interest` is specified as the only type, regions of type `point_of_interest`

            will not be included in a request that filters to an area.<br><br>

        Returns the properties within an custom polygon that represents a
        multi-city area or smaller.

        The coordinates of the polygon should be in [GeoJSON format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) and the polygon must conform to the following restrictions:
          * Polygon size - diagonal distance of the polygon must be less than 500km
          * Polygon type - only single polygons are supported
          * Number of coordinates - must be <= 2000

        market.

        _Note_: If there are no available rooms, the response will be an empty array.

        * Multiple rooms of the same type may be requested by including multiple instances of the `occupancy` parameter.

        * The `nightly` array includes each individual night's charges. When the total price includes fees, charges, or adjustments that are not divided by night, these amounts will be included in the `stay` rate array, which details charges applied to the entire stay (each check-in).

        * The `nightly` array includes each individual night's charges. When the total price includes fees, charges, or adjustments that are not divided by night, these amounts will be included in the `stay` rate array, which details charges applied to the entire stay (each check-in).

      summary: Retrieve Booking
      description: >
        This API call returns itinerary details and links to resume or cancel
        the booking. There are two methods to retrieve a booking:

        * Using the link included in the original Book response, example: https://api.ean.com/v3/itineraries/8955599932111?token=QldfCGlcUA4GXVlSAQ4W

        * Using the email of the booking. If the email contains special characters, they must be encoded to successfully retrieve the booking. Example: https://api.ean.com/v3/itineraries/8955599932111?email=customer@email.com


        <i>Note: Newly created itineraries may sometimes have a small delay between the time of creation and the time that the itinerary can be retrieved. If you receive an error when trying to retrieve an itinerary that was successfully created, or if you receive a response with two fields, namely, `itinerary_id` and `creation_date_time`, then please wait a few minutes before trying to retrieve the itinerary again.</i>

            Ensure your integration passes the customer's IP, not your own. This value helps determine their location and assign the correct payment gateway.<br>

            Including this value greatly eases EPS's internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it explicitly links together request paths for individual user's session.

      description: >
        Returns a complete collection of chains recognized by the Rapid API.


        <br>Chains represent a parent company which can have multiple brands associated with it. A brand can only be associated with one chain. For example, Hilton Worldwide is a chain that has multiple associated brands including Doubletree, Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites.


        <br>The response is a JSON map where the key is the chain ID and the value is a chain object. Each chain object also contains a map of its related brands.


        <br>Note that the set of chain IDs and brand IDs are totally independent of one another. It is possible for a chain and a brand to both use the same number as their ID, but this is just a coincidence that holds no meaning.


        <br>Chain and brand names are provided in English only.

            Insert your own unique value for each user session, beginning with
            the first API call.

            Continue to pass the same value for each subsequent API call during the user's session, using a new value for every new customer session.<br>

            Including this value greatly eases EPS's internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it explicitly links together request paths for individual user's session.
