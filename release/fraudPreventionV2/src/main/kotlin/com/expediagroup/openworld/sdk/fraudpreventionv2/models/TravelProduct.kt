/**
 * The `type` field value is used as a discriminator, with the following mapping: * `CRUISE`: `Cruise` * `AIR`: `Air` * `CAR`: `Car` * `INSURANCE`: `Insurance` * `HOTEL`: `Hotel` * `RAIL`: `Rail`
 * @param price
 * @param type
 * @param inventoryType Type of inventory. Ensure attributes mentioned in dictionary below are set to corresponding values only. `inventory_type` has the following mapping with TravelProduct `type` attribute: *       inventory_type            :      type * ------------------------------------------------------ *  `Cruise`                       : `CRUISE` *  `Air`                          : `AIR` *  `Car`                          : `CAR` *  `Insurance`                    : `INSURANCE` *  `Hotel`                        : `HOTEL` *  `Rail`                         :  `RAIL`
 * @param inventorySource Identifies the business model through which the supply is being sold. Merchant/Agency. * `MERCHANT` is used when Partner is the merchant of record for this order. * `AGENCY` is used when this order is through an agency booking.
 * @param travelersReferences List of travelerGuids who are part of the traveling party on the order for the product. Information for each product and its required travelers should be provided in the API request. If the product booking does not require accompanying quest information then that does not need to be provided in the API request. Example: * For Air products, all travelers' details are required to complete the booking. * For Hotel products, typically the details on the person checking-in is required. * For Car products, typically only the primary driver information is required. If multiple traveler details are in the itinerary, this structure allows to fill up traveler details once in the `travelers` section, and then associate individual products to the respective travelers. This association is made using `traveler_id` field. A GUID can be generated for each object in the `travelers` section. The same GUID can be provided in the `traveler_references` below. The `travelers` array should have at least one `traveler` object, and each `traveler` object should have a `traveler_id` which is not necessarily an account id. Example: *   Travelers * ------------ *  A - GUID1 *  B - GUID2 *  C - GUID3 * *   Products * ------------ * Air *   [GUID1, GUID2, GUID3] * Hotel *   [GUID1] * Car *   [GUID3] * Rail *   [GUID2] * The example above demonstrates the association of travelers with various products. * All three travelers (A, B, and C) are associated with the Air product. * Traveler A is associated with the Hotel. * Traveler C is associated with the Car product. * Traveler B is associated with the Rail product.
